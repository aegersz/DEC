# Declear Thorium

**Declear Thorium** is a passive, solid-state nuclear energy module within the [Digital Energy Cell (DEC)](../README.md) platform. It utilizes embedded thorium-rich dielectric materials to produce a slow, stable trickle of electric energy without risk of meltdown or moving parts.

## Architecture

Declear Thorium is built using a specialized triple-dielectric structure:

- **Dialectric A** – A radiation-tolerant crystal matrix infused with trace conductive elements.  
- **Dialectric B** – A swelling clay-based separator that acts as a thermal and ion migration buffer.  
- **Dialectric C** – A dielectric oil medium infused with thorium isotopes and modifiers such as sulfur, phosphorus, or mineral salts.

These layers are sealed between inert electrodes and encased in radiation-shielded enclosures, offering extreme durability and safety.

## Key Characteristics

- **Meltdown-Proof:** No chain reaction or reactor-grade fuel.  
- **Trickle Output:** Passive, low current generation over decades.  
- **Radiation Contained:** Built-in shielding and auto-grounding.  
- **Maintenance-Free:** Zero moving parts, self-sealing behavior.  
- **Optional Output Conditioning:** Can feed into DEC smart capacitor banks or external storage.

## Energy Process

1. **Embedded Thorium (Th-232)** undergoes low-grade stimulation by environmental gamma or neutron sources.  
2. **Ionic separation and electron shift** occurs across the dielectric layers.  
3. **Slow accumulation of surface charge** is collected via lead-shielded electrodes.  
4. **Stable DC output** is available continuously or buffered into smart systems.

## Safety Features

- **Self-Grounding Terminal:** Auto-dump to earth in case of spike  
- **Thermal Expansion Layer:** Prevents mechanical cracking  
- **Shielding Integration:** Lead + stainless steel + composite shell  
- **No Active Fission:** Cannot enter criticality or cascade
