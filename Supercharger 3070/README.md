# SmartCharger 3070

**SmartCharger 3070** is the intelligent charging interface for the [Digital Energy Cell (DEC)](../README.md), built to ensure safety, lifespan optimization, and compatibility across a range of dielectric configurations.

---

## Overview

SmartCharger 3070 integrates with DEC modules containing:

- **Dialectric A** (crystal layer)  
- **Dialectric B** (clay separator layer)  
- **Dialectric C** (oil dielectric layer)

It provides safe and adaptive charging through hardware-based protections and software-driven analytics.

## Key Features

- **Default Charging Range:** 30%–70%  
- **Manual Override Mode:** 0%–100% (for emergency or full-cycle maintenance)  
- **Thermal Monitoring:** Uses NTC sensors and oil-surface feedback  
- **AI-Enhanced Protection:** Predicts failure points and auto-disconnects  
- **Audible Alarms + Alerts:** Optional integration with fire/security systems  
- **Radiation Grounding Mode:** Optional for breeder configurations  
- **Battery Type Support:** DEC, Lithium-ion, NiMH, Alkaline

## Internal Modules

- **Charge Controller** – Pulse or slow-ramp mode based on dielectric feedback  
- **TempSense Unit** – Real-time thermal curve analysis with soft/hard cutoff  
- **Smart Relay Matrix** – Isolates or bridges power lines as needed  
- **Data Logger** – Cycle tracking, voltage history, and alert generation  
- **FireComm Subsystem** – Optional relay and audible alarm triggering for critical faults
